## About the Driver

### Benefits of the AWS ODBC Driver for PostgreSQL

The official open-source [PostgreSQL ODBC driver](https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=tree;h=refs/heads/master;hb=refs/heads/master) does not natively support RDS PostgreSQL or Aurora PostgreSQL specific features, such as the various [AWS authentication methods](./docs/using-the-aws-driver/authentication/authentication.md), [failover](./docs/using-the-aws-driver/failover/failover.md) or [Aurora Limitless Databases](./docs/using-the-aws-driver/limitless/limitless.md).
The AWS ODBC Driver for PostgreSQL allows client applications to take advantage of the extra RDS/Aurora database features by implementing support for:
1. [IAM database authentication](./docs/using-the-aws-driver/authentication/iam_authentication.md)
2. [Secret Manager authentication](./docs/using-the-aws-driver/authentication/secret_manager_authentication.md)
3. [ADFS authentication](./docs/using-the-aws-driver/authentication/adfs_authentication.md)
4. [Okta authentication](./docs/using-the-aws-driver/authentication/okta_authentication.md)
5. [Failover](./docs/using-the-aws-driver/failover/failover.md)
6. [Limitless](./docs/using-the-aws-driver/limitless/limitless.md)
